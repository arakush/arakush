Hello,
I am Alexis, a Sustainable Energy Engineering student at Simon Fraser University.
I tend to partake in engineering projects relating to EV design, circuitry, SolidWorks, stress testing in 3D models, 3D printing, heat & mass transfer, LCA, and energy systems models for buildings. As for programming, I am familiar with frontend languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, as well as backend languages like C++, and Golang. Additionally, I am familiar with MatLab.

Please reach me at arakush@sfu.ca if you have any questions!
